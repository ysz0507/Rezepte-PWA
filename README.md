It's just a little PWA to save information ordered by a keyword.
Originally it was built to save your most liked recipes. Just click it and get the information.
Some other possible uses are:
<ul>
  <li>cookbook - save page and ingredients of recipes you like</li>
  <li>notepad - store some of the knowledge you earned</li>
  <li>bookshelve - save the names of the books that were recommended to you</li>
  <li>wishlist - save the ideas of the best presents for someone or for yourself</li>
  <li>walking - save your favourite routes</li>
  <li>and anything you can think of</li>
</ul>
But <b>don't</b> use it to save you passwords! It is <b>not</b> encrypted!
