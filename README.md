# Rezepte-PWA

It's just a little PWA to save information ordered by a keyword.
Originally, it was built to save your most liked recipes. Just click it and get the information about it.
Some possibilities are: cookbook, page and ingredients you will need. You could also save some of the experiences you earned. For example: It's enough for 5 people, or it takes about 60 min.
Of course you can also save whatever you want.
